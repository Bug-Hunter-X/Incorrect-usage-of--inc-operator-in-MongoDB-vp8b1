# Incorrect usage of $inc operator in MongoDB
This example demonstrates an incorrect usage of the `$inc` operator in MongoDB. The `$inc` operator is used to increment numeric fields in a document, but in this case, it's used with a string field which results in an error.

## Bug
The bug is in the `updateOne` method of the MongoDB driver. We are attempting to increment a string field with the `$inc` operator, which is not allowed. This results in an error.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the correct data type of the field before incrementing it. In this example, the solution checks if the field is a number before attempting to increment it.
